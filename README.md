# MOVIE-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM

• This notebook implements a movie recommender system.
• Recommender systems are used to suggest movies or songs to users based on their interest or usage history.
• For example, Netflix recommends movies to watch based on the previous movies you've watched.
• In this example, I have used Item-based Collaborative Filter
